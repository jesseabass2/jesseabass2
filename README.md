- 👋 Hi, I’m @jesseabass2
- 👀 I’m interested in anything adrenaline related. Dogs especially my boy Bear. He's a Pungsan.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java/AWS through NSS but still dabble in the healthcare field until next year.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Java related to build a firmer foundation
- 📫 How to reach me...well if you made it this far I'm sure you won't mind working a little harder to reach out via linkedIn.
